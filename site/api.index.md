## Grammar

> ### Syntax Definitions
> 
> Syntax definitions for various grammar constructs are given in one of 
> two forms: Regular Expressions and Hydrocarbon Grammar Syntax. 
> 
> The choice of syntax form is determined by conciseness or whether an expression can be 
> adequetly represented with a particular syntax form. In general, atomic
> constructs will be represented by RegEx, and composite constructs will use
> HCG Syntax.
> 
> Most of the HCG syntax definitions are built from symbols defined within
> [Symbol](./api.symbols.index.md), which have definitions written exclusively
> in RegEx.
